# StockForecast CLI

**StockForecast CLI** is a user-friendly command-line tool for stock analysis and forecasting. It combines statistical models (ARIMA), deep learning (LSTM, GRU, Transformer-based forecasting), ensemble methods (RandomForest, XGBoost), and technical analysis libraries to offer a comprehensive solution for financial data analysis. In addition, it integrates sentiment analysis (FinBERT), model interpretability (SHAP), and interactive visualizations (Plotly).
